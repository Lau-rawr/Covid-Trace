### Project Summary

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that augments traditional contact tracing by relying on self-reported contact information for automated and confidential notifications. The application will also monitor contacts throughout the self-quarantine period, and collect daily self-reported wellness checks.

### Note about Twilio Texting Feature

Our **Contacts** page includes a text button which allows users to send anonymous texts to contacts through Twilio.  This feature is fully functional, however, since we are using a Free Twilio Trial Account, we have disabled our Twilio account in order to avoid being charged for excessive and unintentional usage.  If you would like to use this feature, please alert a Covid-Trace team member so that we can enable it.
